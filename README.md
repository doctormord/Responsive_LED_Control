# doctormord's Responsive Led Control
I mixed the work of [McLighting](https://github.com/toblum/McLighting), [Russell](https://github.com/russp81/LEDLAMP_FASTLEDs) and [Jake's "Grisworld"](https://github.com/jake-b/Griswold-LED-Controller) with [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) (FastLED library 3.1.3 as of this writing), the colorjs colorpicker, color spectrums created via FastLED Palette Knife, and some additional strip animations (included in the Arduino Sketch above).

FastLED 3.1.3 library:
https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED

McLighting library:
https://github.com/toblum/McLighting

Russel's implementation:
https://github.com/russp81/LEDLAMP_FASTLEDs

Jakes's "Grisworld" Led Controller
https://github.com/jake-b/Griswold-LED-Controller

jscolor Color Picker:
http://jscolor.com/

FastLED Palette Knife:
http://fastled.io/tools/paletteknife/

RemoteDebug:
https://github.com/JoaoLopesF/RemoteDebug


If you aren't familiar with how to setup your ESP8266, see the readme on McLighting's git.  It's well written and should get you up and running.

In short you will:

1.  Configure the Arduino IDE to communicate with the ESP8266
2.  Upload the sketch (from this repo) The sketch is setup for a 120 pixel WS2812B GRB LED Strip.   
    (change the applicable options in "definitions.h" to your desire)
3.  Patch FastLED Library

```arduino
// Note, you need to patch FastLEDs in order to use this.  You'll get an
// error related to <avr\pgmspace.h>. Saves more than 3k given the palettes
//
// Simply edit <fastled_progmem.h> and update the include (Line ~29):

#if FASTLED_INCLUDE_PGMSPACE == 1
#if (defined(__AVR__))
#include <avr\pgmspace.h>
#else
#include <pgmspace.h>
#endif
#endif
```

4.  On first launch, the ESP8266 will advertise it's own WiFi network for you to connect to, once you connect to it, launch your browser
    and the web interface is self explanatory.  (If the interface doesn't load, type in "192.168.4.1" into your browser and hit go)
5.  Once the ESP is on your wifi network, you can then upload the required files for the web interface by typing the in IP address
    of the ESP followed by "/edit" (i.e. 192.168.1.20/edit).  Then upload the files from the folder labeled "upload these" from this repo. (Or use ESP8266 filesystem uploader, see below)
6.  Once you have finished uploading, type in the IP of the ESP into your browser and you should be up and running!

Forked from Russel, i removed Adafruit Neopixel references and library calls.

# Uploading SPIFFS data all at once

Use ESP8266FS plugin to upload all files from /data to SPIFFS.

# Improvements/changes so far:

* new effect: Fire (from WS2812FX)
* new effect: RainbowFire
* new effect: Fireworks [single color, rainbow, random] (from McLightning, ported to used FastLED instead off Adafruit Neopixel)
* new settings for effects in webinterface *.htm

* speedup the UI alot by pulling the materialize stuff (.css/.js) from server and using .gz compressed files for the rest
* made the UI more responsive with grouped sections and buttons
* added some more palettes
* integrated Arduino OTA
* included setup of LED-count and maximum allowed LED-current to web-interface and EEprom, so different strings don't need changs in source-code

~~I edited clockless_esp8266.h (in the FastLED platforms folder) and 
kept getting flickering until I incremented the WAIT_TIME up to 18us. 
(also I did "#define FASTLED_INTERRUPT_RETRY_COUNT 3" inside my sketch).~~

# Portions of @jake-b "Griswold" LED controller original README

I bought 1000 WS2811 nodes for my outdoor Christmas light installation this year.
Based on the "Russell's FASTLEDs" project by @russp81, which is in turn based on the "McLighting" project by @toblum

It seemed necessary to name the thing after Clark Griswold, but really just to differentiate this fork from the originals.

@russp81 mixed the work of @toblum with the @FastLED (FastLED library 3.1.3 as of this writing), the colorjs colorpicker, color spectrums created via FastLED Palette Knife, and some additional strip animations.

# Improvements

- Palettes stored as binary files on SPIFFS.  See below for more information on this.
- Display name of the current palette file in the web interface.
- Added ArduinoOTA support so I can update the firmware over WiFi, which will be important when its installed outside.
- Added the ability to store the settings in EEPROM and restore on boot.
- Merged the jscolor interface into the original McLighting interface
- Updated the McLighting interface to retrieve the current settings from the device, and update the UI with the current settings, rather than always default to the defaults.
- General code formatting clean-up.
- Added “RemoteDebug” library for serial console over telnet. (Optional #define)
- Fixed divide-by-zero error that occurs when fps=0 by preventing fps=0 from the UI.
- Updates to the “animated palette” function, now you can select a single palette, or the existing randomized palette after time delay.
- Rearchitected things a bit, now the colormodes.h functions render one single frame, and do not block the main thread.
- Added back the wipe and tv animations from the original McLighting project (removed in LEDLAMP_FASTLEDs)
- Modified TV animation to add some flicker (I like it better)
- Added “effect brightness” setting to allow you to dim the main effect independently of glitter.

# Palettes on SPIFFS

Normally, you use [PaletteKnife](http://fastled.io/tools/paletteknife/) to generate arrays with the palette info.  You then compile this data into your project.  I wanted to be able to update the palettes without recompiling, so I moved them to files in SPIFFS (/palettes directory).  There is a little python program that basically takes the logic from PaletteKnife and outputs a binary file with the palette data instead.  Load these binary files to SPIFFS using the [Arduino ESP8266 filesystem uploader](https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin) or manually.
